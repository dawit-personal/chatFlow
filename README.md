## Project Overview

This project is structured to support a scalable Node.js backend application. Key features of the structure include:

*   **Layered Architecture:** Code is organized into layers for API handling (`src/api`), business logic (`src/services`), data access (`src/repositories`), and utilities (`src/utils`).
*   **Configuration:** Application configuration is managed in the `config/` directory and through environment variables (`.env`).
*   **Root Files:** Core startup (`server.js`), package management (`package.json`), and Docker configuration (`Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`) are located in the project root.
*   **Modularity:** Distinct directories for `middlewares`, `sockets`, `db` (for database related files like migrations/seeds), and `tests` promote modular design.

Further details on specific components can be found within their respective directories or documentation.
